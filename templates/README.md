# cludo/templates

The cludo templates directory contains go-swagger template overrides. Currently the `cli` generator
for go-swagger is under active development and these latest templates currently require a version
of go-swagger later later than `b49f50b58d021e303ce819ab8310add9bad3a99d`.

Please remove old/unused templates as we want to eventually remove the need for any custom templates.
